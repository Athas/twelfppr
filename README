Installation
===

`twelfppr` uses Cabal for build management, so you should be able to
compile and install it with a simple command:

    cabal install

(Ignore the Makefile)

This should pull down the (few) dependencies and install the twelfppr
binary in ~/.cabal/bin.

Now try running it on some signature:

    ~/.cabal/bin/twelfppr -t ~/twelf/bin/twelf-server sources.cfg

Note that the signature defined by sources.cfg should be loadable by
Twelf without error, or `twelfppr` will fail with a cryptic error
message.
